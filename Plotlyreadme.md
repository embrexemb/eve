In this assignment, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The D3 library was used to read a json file of data values.  Data was organized by subject ids that had the microbial species mapped to each subject.  The dashboard showed a bar chart of the top 10 species found for each subject, a meta data bubble chart an overview of all the microbial species found for a subject, the key data for the subject and a gauge chart that showed frequencies of washing for each subject.
