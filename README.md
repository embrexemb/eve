# Latitude Analysis Dashboard using Bootstrap elements
A visualization dashboard website using visualizations created using Jupyter Notebook for proof of concept.
In building this dashboard, individual pages were created for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations.

# Plotly visualizations using json data
![Bacteria by filterforge.com](bacteria.jpg)
This interactive dashboard was built to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. The D3 library was used to read a json file of data values.  Data was organized by subject ids that had the microbial species mapped to each subject.  The dashboard showed a bar chart of the top 10 species found for each subject, a meta data bubble chart an overview of all the microbial species found for a subject, the key data for the subject and a gauge chart that showed frequencies of washing for each subject.

This visualization was set up to analyze current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings.  The test data shows the health risks facing particular demographics. The idea was based on looking through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
To create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age` using D3 objects.  This example uses an animated scatter plot with multiple x and y axes and tooltips coded with D3 objects.
